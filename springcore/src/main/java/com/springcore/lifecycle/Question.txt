In this We will learn about the life cycle of spring->

a)Object creation
b)Value assign
c)init method()-->there should not be any parameter in init method,the name of init method can be change 
d)Use them-read and write
e)destroy method()-->there should not be any parameter destroy method,the name of destroy method can be change

Life cycle of spring using xml -->
Related file-->Samosa.java  ,  Test.java  ,  config.java

In config.xml-->

<bean class="com.springcore.lifecycle.Samosa" id="s1" init-method="init" destroy-method="destroy">

init method="method name" destroy method="method name"-->method name should be the name which is used in the Samosa class

So when init() and destroy() method is called then output is-
Setting price
Inside init method
Samosa [price=10.0]

Here you will notice that destroy method is not being called while I have used it in bean why?
For solving this issue We have to enable "PreShutdownHook of ApplicationContext"
So Instead of using the ApplicationContext I will use the *AbstractAppliactionContext* and import it in the file
will do the *context.registerShutdownHook()* to registering shutdown hook
Like this-->
public class Test {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		-->AbstractApplicationContext context=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("com/springcore/lifecycle/config.xml");
		Samosa s1=(Samosa)context.getBean("s1");
		System.out.println(s1);
		-->context.registerShutdownHook();
	}
}

Now output is-
Setting price
Inside init method
Samosa [price=10.0]
Inside destroy method

Implementing life cycle of Spring using --> Interface <--
Realted file-

We have to implement the two interface in bean
a)InitializingBean-->provide the functionality of init method
b)DisposableBean-->  provide the functionality of destroy method

public class Pepsi implements InitializingBean,DisposableBean{
...
}
import the InitializingBean,DisposableBean and over the cursor on InitializingBean,DisposableBean and there will be one option will show up i.e->
implement unused method-click on it:-thw method will be implement
    @Override
	public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("taking pepsi : init"); 
	}

	@Override
	public void destroy() throws Exception {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("going to put bottle after shopping : destroy");
	}
	
context.registerShutdownHook();-> this method is mandatary to enable destroy method

Now output is-

Setting price
Inside init method
taking pepsi : init
Samosa [price=10.0]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Pepsi [price=5.0]
going to put bottle after shopping : destroy
Inside destroy method

Implementing life cycle of Spring using Annotaion--> Realted file-Example.java , config.xml, Test.java
a)PostConstruct-> for init method
b)PreDestroy ->  for destroy method

In this I have commented the previous bean that I have used for(xml and interface) 

I have created the bean for Example class and set the value but for Implementing the life cycle of spring I made the two method start() and end()
for enable the start() and end() method -I have use the Annotaion above these method
But here I noticed that PostConstruct and PreDestroy annotation are not sujjesting automatically-Why?
Ans-Because PostConstruct and PreDestroy annotation has been removed after java 9 so if you are using the java version above 9 then it will not the sujjest
so You have use the additional dependency injection for sujjeting these annotation--go to these website ->"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-postconstruct-predestroy"
and you will find the annotation.
Now run it but-Again start() and end() method will not called because this annoation are not enabled so for resolving this issue I have enable the annotation 
and this will happen if I will add this tag in config.xml file--> 

<context:annotation-config />

Now output is->
starting method
Example [subject=Maths]
ending method
