In this We will learn about autowired annoation-->
just put the @Autowired above the either variable name,or constructor or setter method;
and one thing- >  <context:annotation-config /> in autoconfig file.

Suppose You have created mutiple bean with different id/name then @Autowired annoatation will confuse that which bean have to execute so
for resolving this problem @Qualifier annotation is used.
@Qualifier("name/id of bean")-->exp-@Qualifier("address1");
